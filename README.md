"I embarked on a project to replicate a custom file upload form using React, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML components. My goal was to gain a deep understanding of the structure and functionality of the form while improving my skills in web development technologies. During Throughout the entire process, I meticulously researched the original form, identified the key components, and implemented three components to render the form in the app component: FormU.js, DragDrop.js, and Toggle.js. I integrated Bootstrap for styling and CSS. for customization, achieving a visually appealing and responsive design. In the future, I aim to further improve the form, as well as drag and drop functionality and accessibility improvements based on feedback.

Overall, this project is not just a faithful copy, it is a complete front-end web application with the expected functionalities.

For me it was a rewarding learning experience, which demonstrated my competence in web development and my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions."
